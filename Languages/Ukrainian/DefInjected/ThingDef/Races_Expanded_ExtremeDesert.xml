  <!-- Camel -->

  <AEXP_Camel.label>camel</AEXP_Camel.label>
  <AEXP_Camel.description>A large land mammal adapted to arid environments. Domesticated since ancient times, its wool and leather are both exceptionally good at insulating against the desert heat, and its milk is quite nourishing. It can be used as a pack animal, but two humps make it extremely uncomfortable to ride.\n\nBy storing water in its large humps and reclaiming moisture from its breath as it exhales, it can go weeks without drinking.</AEXP_Camel.description>
